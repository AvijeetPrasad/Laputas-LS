# Welcome to Laputas!

It is said that the British physicist Lord Kelvin, in the late 1890s, 
proclaimed "There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. 
All that remains is more and more precise measurement."
Within few decades, quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of relativity 
had completely revolutionized physics. No physicist today would assert what
Lord Kelvin did more than a century back. In fact, each new discovery seems 
to ask even bigger and deeper questions. 

In this webpage, we aim to cover some of the intricacies and nuances 
associated with many of the facets of physics, 
including some of these unresolved problems. We will cover topics
ranging from high energy physics to astrophysics. 

We have divided the content into three levels:

1. A general reader can get the basic idea from the text.
2. A more interested reader can grasp the ideas better throught the equations.
3. An advanced reader can tinker with the code on the Google Colab page.

In each of the articles we also suggest some problems for the readers to try out on their own.
Hope youâ€™ll have fun working it out!
